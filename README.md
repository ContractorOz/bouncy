How To Use:
- This app has 3 modes:
  + Add by Distance - constant 
  + Add by Velocity
  + Add by Angle

- The GUI consists of text fields divided into parts: Start/End points, start/end velocity, start/end angle, constant velocity, constant angle, and number of particles to spawn. There is also a FPS counter at the bottom part of the buttons and a textarea for showing some info on the spawning particles.
- Using the button "Add by Distance" will take only the fields for Start/End Points, Constant Velocity, and Constant Angle.
- Similarly, using the button "Add by Angle" will take only the fields for Starting Points X/Y, and Constant Velocity.
- Lastly, using the button "Add by Velocity" will take only the fields for Starting Points X/Y, and Constant Angle.
- The particles will spawn as red Circles in the pane on the right with an area of 1280,720.
